# OS-Scheduling-Process-Simulation

* To use the simulation, you should complete 3 steps, first, to select the type of the   process, number of them and it's preemptive or not and time quantum if its type is round robin

* After the submission, it will produce another configuration to be done, you can go back also to change the first configuration, the configuration that was done it will be showed to be remembered, then you should select every process and set its attributes, the burst time is supported by floating number up to 3 digits, there's some error handling, if you enter non correct floating number if didn't select any process, you will get an alarm message, after the submission of each process, its configuration will change (if it's correct configuration) in the table below and replace its orange with gray and the process status's will be initialized, if you start the scheduling and there's a not initialized process, it will pop up a message dialog and can't start the simulation with the complete correct initialization of each process

* Third, the simulation window will show in a dependent window, you will see the Gantt Chart and every process average time and the total average time, there will be a horizontal scroll bar if the width of the Gantt Chart is more than the window, you can also use right and left buttons in the keyboard to select a process in a row to show its attributes int that's time with unique color and you can do the same behavior using the forward and backward buttons, there's another option to automate the selected process using the enter key or play button, it will change every second automatically

## Notes:
```
* you can start another scheduling withought closing the current simulation
* you can't go back or forword during the auto player is running, you will a message 
```
